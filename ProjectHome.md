RoverGauge depends on the [libcomm14cux](http://code.google.com/p/libcomm14cux) library, which in turn requires building a special cable to connect to the ECU's wiring harness. The wiki for libcomm14cux contains [information about how to build the hardware interface](http://code.google.com/p/libcomm14cux/wiki/HardwareInterface).
